peaberry is licensed under the [Apache License 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) therefore we require all contributions that are of existing code _(code that wasn't developed inside of the project from scratch)_ to be attached to an issue and explicitly licensed under the same Apache License.

Project members can only commit contributions to subversion that they personally created specifically for contribution to peaberry.  This is the standard stream of fresh original work, small enhancements and patches that are the normal flow of project life.

Any software or other contribution that was not created explicitly for peaberry in the peaberry project is considered to be a 'Bulk Contribution'. This status is independent of the purpose or author of said contribution. For example:

  * Personal utilities that a committer always uses on projects
  * Code from other open source projects that have a compatible license
  * Code from proprietary projects for which the donor has clear title

Any Bulk Contribution:

  1. Will be donated via the project [bug tracking system](http://code.google.com/p/peaberry/issues/list) as a contribution under the Apache License
  1. Will be accompanied by a Software Grant
  1. Will be checked by an existing peaberry project member

before it can be accepted and committed into subversion.
